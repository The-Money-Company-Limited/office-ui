# Office artifact template experiment

This fork builds a static release for a Cool Computer artifact. Each release
contains the viewer/editor bundle (with `template.json`, its version), one
document, `artifact.json`, and `cool.json`. It runs in the browser without a computer VM or a RuntimeVM
code change.

For the build pipeline, Cloudflare request path, and later integration contract,
see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

The document fills a framed editor with a small gap from the viewport edges.
Its controls use a copy of RuntimeVM's light and dark appearance tokens, with
glass surfaces on the XLSX, DOCX, and PDF toolbars. The workbook's own
appearance button persists the choice under RuntimeVM's
`cool-computers-theme` key. There is no artifact header, logo, or wallpaper.

| File | UI in this fork                                                               | Save path              |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| XLSX | Experimental spreadsheet editor, including chart selection and movement       | Automatic via page bridge |
| DOCX | Experimental word processor                                                   | Automatic via page bridge |
| PPTX | Presentation viewer only; this fork has no PPTX editor                        | Download original PPTX |
| PDF  | PDF editor for annotations, forms, signatures, redaction, and page operations | Automatic via page bridge |

The PDF editor does not rewrite arbitrary existing page text. DOCX, XLSX, PDF,
and HTML slide edits save through the injected `cool: "doc"` page bridge.
Without an access response granting `canSave`, documents open in viewing mode.
The XLSX editor switches to read-only above 5 MiB. The bundled PDFium WASM is
served from the artifact itself; optional fonts and stamp resources may still
use external URLs.

HTML slide decks use the built-in slides editor. Saves contain the changed
slide HTML files and `deck/deck.json` together; Download still offers ZIP and PPTX.

## Engines

The DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX engines are our forks, linked from sibling
checkouts by `pnpm.overrides` in the root `package.json`:
`../react-docx/packages/react-viewer`, `../react-xlsx/packages/react-xlsx`,
and `../react-pptx/packages/react-viewer`. Build a fork before building this
template; its `dist` is what Vite bundles.

## Build and stage

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter v4 artifact-template:build
pnpm --filter v4 artifact-template:stage /absolute/path/to/report.xlsx /absolute/path/to/new-release-directory
```

The stage command accepts `.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, and `.pdf`. An omitted
output directory stages directly into
`apps/v4/experiments/artifact-template/dist`; a specified output directory
must not already exist. Rebuild after changing source. The release is a complete
static directory; Vite emits relative asset URLs so it works at an artifact
root or a local preview subpath. The stage command checks the 25 MiB per-asset,
20,000-file, and 1 GiB total limits. A failed stage removes a newly created
output directory.

To preview several releases from a common parent:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 4173 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory /absolute/path/to/releases
```

To publish one release when ready:

```sh
cool publish /absolute/path/to/new-release-directory --name example
```

The corresponding ZIP may also be uploaded through the Cool Computers publish
UI.

## Check Comments and Ink locally

[`dev/comments-harness.mjs`](./dev/comments-harness.mjs) serves staged
releases with RuntimeVM's real comment script injected, as the gateway does,
and a stand-in comment layer that saves every pick at once:

```sh
node dev/comments-harness.mjs /path/to/runtimevm /path/to/releases 4310
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4310/<release>/`, press **Comment**, then click or draw.
`http://127.0.0.1:4311/notes?agent` lists each saved anchor as the owner's
agent reads it.

## RuntimeVM fit

RuntimeVM publishes complete static file sets; it has no template identifier.
A release staged here is the composition a future template feature would do
on the server: a versioned bundle (`template.json`) plus one document. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#contract-for-a-later-artifact-template-feature).
This experiment leaves RuntimeVM untouched.

## Autosave development and verification

`dev/autosave-harness.mjs <release folder> [port]` serves a staged artifact,
injects the same-window page contract, and writes saves into that folder.
`POST /__doc/control` accepts `mode` (`online`, `offline`, `read_only`,
`signed_out`, `conflict`, `path_not_allowed`, `not_document`, `too_large`,
`error`) or `changed: true`. It also accepts `retryAfter` (seconds),
`pollFailed`, and `receipt: "late" | "drop" | "normal"`; `deliver: true`
releases held receipts. `GET /__doc/control` lists writes and attempted request
IDs, bases, payload hashes and times. The stand-in validates declared paths,
slide IDs, referenced images and the 25/64 MiB limits, and retains 32 receipts
for 24 hours (`advance` moves its receipt clock in milliseconds).
The production bridge still owns authorization, size limits and atomic releases.

Run checks on Modal only, from `office-remote`:

```sh
./r sync office-ui react-docx react-xlsx
./r run react-docx 'pnpm --filter @extend-ai/react-docx build'
./r run react-xlsx 'pnpm --filter @extend-ai/react-xlsx build'
./r run office-ui 'sh apps/v4/experiments/artifact-template/dev/verify.sh'
./r run office-ui 'sh apps/v4/experiments/artifact-template/dev/browser.sh'
./r run office-ui 'node apps/v4/experiments/artifact-template/dev/negative.mjs'
```

The browser cases use real edits, download conflict copies, verify persisted
bytes after reload, check clean external reloads, and exercise read-only and
offline access for all four kinds. Negative controls temporarily build the
pre-autosave entry point from `59895b6^` and require every browser case to fail, then
restore the working source and bundle. Contract negative controls disconnect
the message handler and require every test to fail. Results and screenshots
stay in the ignored `dev/results/` directory.

Round-2 browser cases also cover timed-out retries, late receipts with newer
edits, real beforeunload dialogs, retryAfter during visibility changes, failed
access polls, and separate path/not-document messages. Long bridge/controller
timeouts are accelerated only by the browser tests. The controller waits 20
minutes, beyond the script's 19 minutes; a timeout never discards the request.
Contract negative controls additionally run the new cases against `59895b6`.
